# What is this?
This is a simple script used to clean up Screaming Frogs **structured_data_all.csv** report into something more organised. By default Screaming Frog lists structured data in the order it finds it. Useful, but not great for getting a feel for the various types and their coverage. 

## How do I use this?
Make sure you have python3, this, and any dependencies installed then clone this to your local, add the **structured_data_all.csv** and doubleclick. It'll create a file called **SortedSchema.csv**. Thats it.

## This is crap
